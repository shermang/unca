Media: Viddler

This adds support for the Viddler video sharing service, available at http://www.viddler.com/

To use this module, you'll first need to install Media module.

In the web tab of the media browser, paste the video URL (like http://www.viddler.com/v/bdce8c7) or code from Viddler. To get the Viddler code, click the Share button on a video, then choose the 'Wordpress.com' short code. It should look something like [viddler id=7699d974 w=545 h=307].

Configure your video dimensions in the file types settings.
